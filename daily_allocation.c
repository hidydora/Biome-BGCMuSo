instead of separete spinup_daily_allocation, common daily_allocation rutin is for both normal and spinup phase
In the spinup phase exactly enough mineral N is added at each time step to satisfy the total demand of
plant and microbe.

20/07/2001:  Changes were made in the logic of the retranslocation of nitrogen, from 
V4.1.1 back to those of V4.1. The underlying reasons for this change are 
the polarised logics between the two versions. V4.1 considered a recipient 
based flow, the deployment of retranslocated leaf nitrogen in the spring is
based on the requirement of the plant, access by the plant to this pool was
ungoverned. That is to say that the plant could access all the nitrogen in
one day if it so required. This often resulted in an initial modelled NEE
spike in the early growing season, something that is seen in the EUROFLUX
data. V4.1.1 can be considered as a donor based flow, in that the deployment
of the retranslocated leaf nitrogen in the spring is a fractionation of the
initial size of the translocated pool at the end of the previous growing
season, not a translation in any way of plant demand. In test simulations,
this induced the long-term build up of nitrogen, inaccessible to the plant,
conceptually turning the retranslocated pool into a permanent nitrogen sink.
The translation of this logic to the overall modelled NEE flux was to induce
a mid-season crash in productivity as a result of nitrogen deficiency, something
unseen in the EUROFLUX data.

4/17/2000 (PET): Comparisons with eddy flux data showed that the 
deployment of retranslocated leaf N for new growth was too rapid early in
the growing season under N-limited conditions, causing an early spike in
growth rate which was never observed in the eddy flux data.  The original
mechanism for deployment of retranslocated N allowed access to the entire
retranslocated N pool on each day. This has now been changed so that only
a fraction of the total retranslocated N pool is available for deployment
as new growth on each day. The macro DAYSNDEPLOY defines the
number of days over which the existing retrans N pool can be used up, and
on each day ns.retransn/DAYSNDEPLOY defines the maximum amount of N available
from the retrans N pool for new growth. 

4/17/2000 (PET): Part of the problem identified through comparisons with eddy 
flux data was related to the treatment of daily allocation in the face of
a cpool deficit. The original logic was to apply all available C each day
to the cpool until the deficit was eliminated, resulting in an abrupt shift
mid-spring when shifting over to new growth (no growth respiration attached to
C allocated to reduce cpool deficit).  The new approach that avoids this
abrupt shift is to apply C from the daily available pool at a rate that 
would alleviate the existing deficit if continued at a constant rate over
N days. As the deficit grows, this rate also increases, since N is a constant.
The result is that a dynamic equilibrium is established between withdrawals
and additions to the cpool, with small daily allocations throughout the 
growing season to make up for the small daily expenditures for maintenance
respiration through the winter. The new parameter (N) is called 
DAYSCRECOVER, and for now it is included as a macro definition in this file.

4/17/2000 (PET): Another part of the early-season spike observed under N
limitation is due to the accumulation of excess soil mineral N. The original
algorithm didn't have any explicit controls on the accumulation of soil
mineral N except leaching, fire, and denitrification tied to the rate of
decomposition processes. However, excess mineral N in real soils is quickly
lost to the atmosphere, and the new logic reflects this fact. On each day,
a specified proportion of the excess mineral N (not required for plant growth
or microbial growth) is lost to an atmospheric sink. This proportion is
defined below as BULK_DENITRIF_PROPORTION. This is a gross approximation
of the real processes, but it has the desired effect of eliminating
the accumulation of soil mineral N.
